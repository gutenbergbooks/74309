<p><i>All that follows takes place at</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman’s</span> <i>house in the
neighbourhood of Lancaster Gate; a large house in a
terrace of others like it. It begins in the dining-room;
middle-class, but sumptuously so. Dinner is in its final
stages; a decanter of port is on the table, and a goodly
array of the best fruits to be bought.</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> <i>is
seated at the table very occupied with a fruit</i>; <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Freeman</span> <i>sits opposite to him; there is no one else in the
room</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> <i>is rather short and rather round,
a little red and a little bald</i>; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span> <i>is his
wife</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> <i>continues to eat his fruit—there is no
other sound</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> (<i>when his mouth is unoccupied</i>): Disgusting!
(<i>He reaches out and selects another fruit.</i>) Makes
me sick!</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>The door opens and such an attractive head comes
round it.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Head</span>: <i>No!</i>... He hasn’t.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>The head withdraws and the door shuts.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: <i>Abominable!</i> I wonder if Florence
knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: She’s out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Rosie then. (<i>Calling.</i>) Gwen!...
Gwen!!</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>The door reopens and the head reappears.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Does Rosie know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Head</span>: No.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>The head disappears and the door shuts.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: <i>Monstrous!</i> (<i>Then suddenly he shouts
again</i>) HI! Gwen!... Gwen!!</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>The door reopens and the head reappears.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Head</span>: Yes?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>For answer</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> <i>angles for his keys in
his hip pocket, catches them with a laborious spasm and
throws them on to the table</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Liqueur.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>The owner of the head comes into the room.</i> <span class="smcap">Gwen</span>,
<i>the daughter; twenty-four years old, and very attractive.
She comes straight to the table, picks up the keys,
and unlocks a cupboard in a handsome sideboard.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Shut the door, dear.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Gwen</span> <i>goes and shuts the door</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s cold.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Gwen</span> <i>returns to the cupboard</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Benedictine.... No. Chartreuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Green?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Yellow.... What’s the time? (<i>But
he gets no answer.</i>) Nobody in this house ever knows what
the time is. (<i>So he looks at his own watch.</i>) <i>D’Ha!</i> He
won’t be back to dinner now.... (<i>He selects a cigar
from a box on the table</i>) ... preposterous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: You’re worried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Of course I’m worried ... he left
the office three-quarters of an hour too early for lunch,
and he never came back at all. I haven’t set eyes on him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: He came home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Eh? What excuse did he give?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: I only heard him upstairs in his
attic ... playing the piano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: <i>Playing the piano!!!</i> I ask you ... a
grown man ... what is ’e? Twenty-six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Twenty-eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Nonsense. (<i>Then he considers.</i>) Oh,
yes, twenty-eight. He walks calmly out of his office in the
City in the middle of the morning, he leaves an afternoon’s
work untouched and he comes home and PLAYS THE
PIANO.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: He was always fond of music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: <i>I’m</i> fond of music, but if I was to
behave like that I’d be playing a barrel organ in a fortnight
... where you going?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Gwen</span> <i>has given him his liqueur, relocked the
cupboard, put the keys back on the table, and is going
quietly out of the room; her father’s question is mere
family curiosity</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Drawing-room—going to read.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>She goes out.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span> (<i>when the door has closed safely</i>): I’ve
got something on my mind, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What about?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: About him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>In answer</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span> <i>goes to a writing-desk.
He continues his own train of thought.</i></p>
</div>

<p>He’s not worth a damn in the office. He could be.
(<i>His indignation increases.</i>) He walks in an hour late, he
walks out an hour early, and he never walks back at
all.... No “whys,” no “wherefores” ... when I
think of all that I’ve done for that boy.... (<i>He becomes
conscious that the hand that isn’t holding a cigar is holding a
letter</i>) ... What’s this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Smell it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Filthy ... what’s wrong with it?
... only scent, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: It isn’t Frankie’s writing.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> <i>consults it</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>He left it about ... he’s had others like it ... he’s
told Rosie to take them straight upstairs to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Rosie tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: I’ve noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What John does in his spare time is
nothing to do with me. It’s not his spare time I’m bothered
about ... it’s his working life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: He <i>is</i> engaged to Frankie ...
suppose there should be anything serious with this other
girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What other girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: <i>Somebody</i> writes those letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: ... Um.... I shouldn’t worry
... he’s not quite a fool.... Leave it to me. I’ll
give him this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: He’s not happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: If a man neglects his work as John’s
doing, he can’t expect to be happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Has he told you he isn’t going to
spend Christmas with us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Where’s he going...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: To stay with Mr. ... I don’t
know his name ... his friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Funny-lookin’ feller ... always in
the house. <i>I</i> know. That’s another thing; who <i>is</i> this
feller?... I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span> (<i>taking her son’s part</i>): He’s always
had the attic for his own ... hasn’t he? ... with his
own friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I know. I’ve never interfered. I’ve
no wish to interfere ... when he was a baby in the
nursery up there—or a schoolboy with his friends, but
now ... here’s this feller ... he called yesterday
when John was out—I met him on the stairs ... didn’t
know him from Adam; we grinned ... dam’ silly....
Hullo!</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>There has been a prolonged moaning wailing sound—like
the cry of some agonised ghost.</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>
<i>hurries to the window</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s Frankie ... in the new car; with her father.
Hullo! How are you! (<i>He waves cordially. The window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
being shut there it not the remotest chance of his being heard.</i>)
Hullo, Frankie ... pretty girl she’s getting. (<i>He comes
away from the window.</i>) ’Spose she’s come for John. I
shall speak to him to-night, when he comes in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: I shouldn’t say too much about his
friend upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Um?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Well, we did make the arrangement
he should be private upstairs—as if it were his own flat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I don’t suppose I’ve been up there for
a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Nor have I ... he might take a
flat of his own. I shouldn’t like that.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Rosie</span>, <i>a picturesque little parlour-maid, shows in</i>
<span class="smcap">Frankie Sewell</span>. <i>She is a pretty girl of twenty-four
or so, and is very good at tennis and hockey.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Well, Frankie dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Good evening, Mrs. Freeman.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>They kiss.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What have you done with your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: He couldn’t come in; he’s going to call
back for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Your young man isn’t in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Isn’t he?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>Again the cry of the agonised ghost.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Your gate’s in awfully good voice to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> (<i>who has gone to the window</i>): Wants oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> (<i>at a bowl of chocolates on the table</i>): May I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Of course, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> (<i>back from the window; aside to his
wife</i>): It’s John. Take her into the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span>: Let’s join Gwen, dear. It’s so much
nicer in the drawing-room. Bring the chocolates if you
like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Oh no, thanks; I’ll take one more, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I’ll be with you in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Freeman</span> (<i>ushering</i> <span class="smcap">Frankie</span> <i>out</i>): Gwen’ll be so
pleased. She’s only reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>with quick concern</i>): Is Frankie here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>evidently upset</i>): She said she wasn’t coming
round to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: You ought to have let your mother
know you weren’t coming back to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>puzzled</i>): But ... surely ... I thought you
were all going out to dinner with the Cleavers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: To-morrow night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ve made a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: You have ... had your dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Restaurant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Some girl, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I was by myself.</p>

home?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>doesn’t answer; after a searching look at him

<p>Of course, if you prefer your own company, that’s
nothing to do with me, but your life from ten o’clock in
the morning till five in the evening <i>does</i> belong to me.
(<i>In answer to a look from his son he expands that.</i>) It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
belongs to the firm. Now look here, young man, I can
put this in a nutshell. You’ve been engaged to Frankie
some time, on the understanding I make you a junior
partner when you marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: How much do you get now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Five hundred a year. A thousand
when you marry; and a yearly rise after that. Of course
your life belongs to the firm—and will do, more and
more. It’s about time you realised that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I realise it all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Then I want to know why you left
the office an hour before lunch—and never came back
after lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ... It’s difficult to explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I daresay it is; but it’s the sort of
thing that’s got to be explained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I don’t think you understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I daresay I shan’t—but I’ll have a
dam’ good try. I’m not quite a fool, though you think I
am ... any other man employed in the firm who did
what you’ve done to-day without good reason would get
the sack. I want to know your reason. Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It will sound very trivial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: That doesn’t matter ... I’m waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’m trying to write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What d’you mean—“write”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Articles; and a book——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ... the world in general.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I want to. I got stuck—this morning in the
office, I got an idea that I thought might unstick me
... I only meant to go out for a walk for a few minutes,
but it came so clear in my head that I came home and
worked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: You were playing the piano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Strumming between whiles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I see ... now look here ... I’ve
got no objection to your writing articles, or whatever it
is and strumming on the piano—it’s a very nice thing to
be able to do ... these things may be all very well in
their place—but their place is not the best working hours
of your life ... that’s what you’ve got to understand.
Now, listen to me, my boy, you’ve got a <i>niche</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ve got a what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: A NICHE—will you please not
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I beg your pardon; it sounded comic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Well, it isn’t comic. You’ve got a
very pretty little income waiting for you; and a prettier
little wife, but if you think you’re going to inherit the
whole show mooning away a few hours at the office,
when it happens to suit you, because I and others work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
hard for you there all day—<i>and have done for the best
part of our lives</i>—you’re vastly mistaken. The business
is your bread and butter; your life; and you’ve got to
give the best part of your life to it; you get an idea in
your head, and that Robinson contract cropped up in
the afternoon, and you precious nearly lost the firm a
thousand pounds ... what have you got to say to that?</p>

important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: You’re a perfect dam’ fool: <i>work</i>!
You’ve got no sense of values.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: We’ve a <i>different</i> sense of values.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: I’m not going to argue. It’s not going
to happen again; do you grasp that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Need we discuss it to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: There’s no discussing to be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’m sorry. I see your point of view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: That’s splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Rotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>with some deliberation</i>): We only have a certain
amount of energy and vitality in us, Colin; and I’m using
mine up on things that are utterly unimportant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: The same tack you were on last time I saw
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’re not going to get much sympathy out
of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Oh! ... why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: John! You can overdo ideals ... they can
make one rather useless and a little bit silly.... I’ve
been thinking about you a good deal while I’ve been
away.... I’d made up my mind to tell you what I
thought of you one of these days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Now, please. I’m in no mood to wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Well——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Come on; out with it; what have you been
thinking? What’s wrong with me?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>There is a certain eager impatience in his manner.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Well—to be quite frank with you—I think
all this talk about the business being a waste of your life
is rather stupid. The world’s in a devil of a mess; we’re
all living on a volcano; but, as far as one can be sure of
anything, your business is sure; you get a very good
screw; you get all your evenings to yourself; in a world
where ninety per cent of people are continually anxious
about their livelihood, your comfort and comparative
wealth are assured. You’re a damned lucky man, John,
and you’ve got no right to go about grousing about
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Can I be quite frank answering that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There’s one big difference between us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It’s difficult to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Don’t be a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You never went into the trenches.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>This causes a sudden stoppage in the dialogue,
momentary but the severance is complete; it doesn’t go
on in quite the same tone afterwards.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: No. I agree to that difference—very humbly;
but I don’t see what difference that makes about the
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It makes the hell of a difference to <i>me</i> ... it’s
hateful to talk about it ... but there it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span> (<i>gently</i>): I’m interested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>responding</i>): There were several of us, Colin,
who used to talk about the whole thing out there; I
mean, why the whole thing had happened, and what we
were going to do about it when it was over ... a good
many of us to start with ... we got fewer; the lucky
ones were killed outright. Jack Bardsley got half his face
blown away and <i>can’t</i> talk now; Peter Glen’s blind;
Chris—Chris was engaged to a most attractive girl ...
he was mad about her ... used to talk to her at night
... I heard him once, when he thought I was
asleep—he got a bit of shrapnel in his stomach and
thighs, and had to be cut away. He never married. Little
Westerby’s mad.... I’m the only one left....
Sometimes I think I’ve got no right to be alive at all,
Colin—just a fluke ... there are millions of my age,
skull and bone and rotting flesh just under the earth over
there....</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Colin</span> <i>has no answer ... the short silence is
tense ... then he goes on more calmly</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>If the war hadn’t happened I should have married
Frankie; and gone into the business, and settled down to
it ... but I <i>can’t</i> just go on using my life up aimlessly—or
what seems to me aimlessly, as if nothing had happened
... to hear them talk—father and his lot, you’d
think nothing had happened—<i>my God</i>!</p>

<p>It’s hard to talk about it; it’s hard to feel a thing very
deeply, and talk about it, and not sound priggish; but
I must talk to somebody; you’re the only one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You’re an idealist, really. You wrote “A
Pair of Pyjamas,” and you’ve made the devil of a lot of
money, but you know the real worth of things; that’s
why you get angry with me when I still care about
ideals; it makes you uncomfortable; and you hate being
uncomfortable, because you’ve made too much money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I shall have another of your drinks and then I
shall go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: For the love of God, don’t! Not till you need.
Colin, things can’t go on like they are with me, I want
your advice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Are you doing any writing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes; of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You ought to stick to the business, and do
your own work in the evenings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ... We fought like hell out there all day
and all night; we didn’t just let off a few guns in the
evenings, as a sort of hobby, after we’d spent the day doing
something else. If we’re going to have any sort of world
for our children after those years of bloody slaughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
it seems to me we’ve got to fight like hell all the time
now. It’s no good writing anything unconsidered these
days. One must read, and think, and meet people, and
be quiet.... You can’t serve God and Mammon.
There are some jolly good things in that book; Colin,
it’s dreadful to spend one’s best energies doing something,
when you feel you ought to be doing something else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’ve got an Urge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ve got something horrible. My father told me
it was a Niche: you say it’s a Nurge!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: It’s what Quakers get. The spirit urges and
they feel wicked if they don’t follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I feel miserable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And, incidentally, while I mess on day after
day, I’m getting my life into more of a muddle. I feel a
cad about Frankie, and I feel a cad about Toby; I really
don’t know what I ought to do about either of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’re engaged to Frankie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Before I went to France. The daughter of my
father’s partner; both families delighted; and they’ve all
taken it up at the point where it was left off as if it was
just the same; it isn’t, nothing’s just the same ... for
one thing when I was engaged I was innocent ... quite
... one learnt more than soldiering in France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I don’t know why you should put <i>that</i> down
to the war—it happens to some of us even in peace time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It complicates things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: In the old days Frankie and I used to go about
together a lot—like any respectably engaged couple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I used to take her to the theatre, and straight
back to her house afterwards; her mother couldn’t sleep
unless she knew Frankie was in; and I always said good
night to her on her doorstep with a kiss—quite a nice
one, but perfectly respectable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That was all. I don’t say I never wanted any
more. However, I didn’t expect any more; I didn’t know
any more, and I was quite ready to go on like that till
we were married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I was terrified of getting killed in France before
I’d had any experience at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Just before an attack, when I was quite sure I
was going to get knocked out, I went off the deep end
and had my experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Then we attacked ... it was funny; I remember
feeling very proud of myself—and I didn’t get
knocked out. Afterwards I thought a great deal about
that first little French girl, and about Frankie; and one
night I realised I loved Frankie desperately, because I
wanted her like that; and because of Frankie I kept clear
of any more of it.... I just lived for my next leave,
and the moment when I should see Frankie again ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and the first time we were alone again—it was in this
room—I was standing over there and she came in, and
came towards me and I went to meet her, and I put my
arms round her and held her close—closer than I’d ever
done before. My God, I loved her that moment....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: She pushed me away. She hardly said anything;
but she made me feel that she was a little angry and a
little indignant—I’ve never felt such a fool in my life
... before I went back to the front that leave, I’d met
Toby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I remember. You still see her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Sometimes. She’s coming here to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Upstairs. It’s like my own flat, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes—but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I know. But I was certain they were all going
out to dinner. And she’s always wanted to see the attic;
and they haven’t gone out; and now Frankie’s turned up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Frankie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes; she’s in the drawing-room; I’m worried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I’m not surprised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’m desperately anxious to get Toby up there
without her meeting anybody. It’s an underhand business;
it’s got to stop. (<i>He is troubled.</i>) They’ve never been so
close; in any sort of way.... Colin, I don’t make love
to Frankie; not at all; she doesn’t seem to want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes, I think so; that’s the trouble. I never get
any <i>response</i> from her. It makes me rather uncomfortable
with her, and shy! She doesn’t seem to miss anything ...
but, unless, in my marriage, that part of it is as perfect,
and as beautiful as ... as Toby has taught me it can be,
my marriage will be a failure. I’m getting afraid it isn’t
in Frankie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: It may be. You never can tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And it may not be ... a mistaken marriage
messes up two lives at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: But they’re not uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It’s silly, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: But there it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Do you know what I believe I <i>ought</i> to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Go to Frankie and either break off our engagement,
or else ask her to come away with me somewhere....
I’m perfectly serious; you may say “There it is
... it’s the way Civilisation has always managed it.”
Civilisation made millions of young people kill and maim
and torture one another for five bloody years—there’s
something wrong with Civilisation. I don’t mean that
because a thing was there before the war it <i>must</i> be wrong—but
it <i>may</i> be ... a good many things have got to be
thought out again from the beginning—this business of
marriage is one of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Have you said anything about it to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: No.</p>

that’ll mean one to wait at dinner, and that’s ever so much
nicer—and I’m going to give you such lovely little
dinners—when you bring your friends home—and
p’r’aps when you don’t sometimes!... Oh, and I’ve
furnished your study to-day in my head—it’s going to be
ever so comfy ... and you can write your book there
in the evenings ... I won’t come near you if you don’t
want me to ... you know, dear, we couldn’t have a
smaller house than the little one at the corner, could
we? ... and it’s really ever so cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Oh, don’t be ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: If I was engaged to a man, and he wouldn’t
let me kiss him, I’d jolly well go and kiss somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Gwen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I would. There are times when you must be
kissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Gwen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Well, there are—don’t you ever feel like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: No; besides <i>her</i>; she’d kiss anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I don’t see why you should say that—perhaps
they’re in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Love! What he feels for her isn’t love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It’s what I’d want my man to feel for me ...
if ever I have a man in love with me again that I want,
I ... (<i>But</i> <span class="smcap">Frankie</span> <i>is crying</i>.) Oh, Frankie. (<i>She goes
to her.</i>) Don’t cry ... I didn’t mean what I said ...
yes I did ... but not to say it like that ... Frankie
... it isn’t a bit simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Yes, it is. Quite simple. He’s been a beast;
nothing can alter that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There’s a light in the drawing-room.</p>

since.</p>

I trusted you ... I hate being deceived ... it’s been
going on all this time and I never knew it ... all the
time you were with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>quickly</i>): But I never made love to you ... it’s

never been here before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Hasn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: No.... They were two quite distinct relationships,
mine with you—and with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: I should hope so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ve not made love to you, not because I
haven’t wanted to, but because you didn’t want me
to....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: I’m glad I didn’t. I don’t want to share
that sort of thing, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You wouldn’t have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: If you’d wanted to make love, I shouldn’t have
wanted anybody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: That’s easy enough to say now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ve been wrong. I’ve let things drift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: All this time, I’ve hoped something would
flare up between us, and then it would have been perfect—but
it hasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: You say it’s my fault too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It’s nobody’s fault. We’re different—that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Do you want to marry this girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: It’s raining; and he’s got no coat, and
slippers. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Colin</span>.) You ought to go and fetch him in.</p>

to-night he was as obstinate as a pig. He would come;
said he wanted to see John particularly. And there was
only the most expensive box left for to-morrow night.
He would get it. It cost him about twelve guineas. I
wonder who he’s going to take.</p>

<p>What are you doing with yourself these days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Nothing special.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Have you kept on your nursing at all,
since the war?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: No. And then I only ran errands for the nurses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Did you like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Rather. It was something outside home I
wasn’t cross-examined about. I often envy <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: <i>Me?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: John often tells me about you, and your office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It’s a kind of a literary agency, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: That’s the sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It must have been awfully adventurous—starting
on your own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I had a good training as a secretary. Then
an election came and I had a girl to help me, and I found
I could boss her. So I got three girls and bossed them—made
them work for me, instead of me working for
somebody else. Now I’ve got ten in the office—and
several young men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It must be splendid to have built up something
like that for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: It’s very interesting. The girls are
interesting, too; they bring all their troubles to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What sort of troubles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Men—mostly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Are you a good sort of person to bring your
troubles to?</p>

I am.</p>

them.</i></p>

<p>You can say what you like; I shan’t cry again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> (<i>unexpectedly defiant</i>): Well, I’m quite sure
I don’t love him! I was sobbing away upstairs, but I
found it was for the drawing-room curtains I’m not going
to buy; not for him. Of course, I’m angry and hurt at
being deceived. And I don’t see why I shouldn’t be!...
But you can say what you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span> (<i>suddenly</i>): Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: If I ask you some questions—things that’ll
help me if I know—will you answer them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: If I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: You’re not married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Have you ever let anybody love you? You
know what I mean. Words are difficult—I don’t want
to be frightened by them.... Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Just one man, or more than one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: More than one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Tell me about it, with <i>all</i> of them, please!</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>A little smile breaks on</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret’s</span> <i>lips, and the

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Don’t laugh, please. I don’t mean it to be
anything to laugh at. I ask because I want to know. Not
about you, but about love. I’m ashamed to be as old as
I am, and not know—You have knowledge, and I
haven’t.... So will you tell me, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Ask away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: When you didn’t know anything at all, how
did it first happen?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>A pause. Then</i>:</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> (<i>beginning slowly in recollection</i>): A man I
was doing some work for asked me to join a walking
party in the Lakes. We started all together. Half-way
through, he and I branched off to walk across a pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and meet the others on the other side. I don’t know
whether he meant to meet them. I meant to. But we
didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What sort of a man was he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: An enthusiast about freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: How old?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: About thirty. We walked among mountains
and talked a great deal, and when it was getting
dark, we reached an inn. And there we had dinner, and
there we stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Did you love him very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: No. I was curious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: It’s queer. We hadn’t got love, which
nowadays seems to me the only justification—yet I’ve
never had any regrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Haven’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: We were full of air and sky, and ideas
for making the world better; probably very silly, but
quite genuine. And he was very gentle and understanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: What happened when you <i>did</i> meet the
others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: We didn’t. We walked in the other
direction for a week. Then we came back to London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Then he fell in love with another girl.
I daresay he taught her what he taught me. That seems
to be his mission in life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> (<i>indignant</i>): That’s what always happens—weren’t
you furious and ashamed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I was awfully pleased with myself! I
was living in a boarding-house in Bloomsbury. I couldn’t
afford a room of my own, or to go out in the evenings.
I used to have to sit in the drawing-room with a lot of
old spinster ladies, knitting and playing patience and
talking scandal. Before the Lakes, I used to think I should
go mad, sometimes; but afterwards, when I looked round
at them all, there was a sort of triumphant glee in me.
I used to say to myself, “I know more about life than
you do. Poor old things!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: That must have been topping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: It was rather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: ... Who was the next?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I fell in love; so it’s not easy to talk
about. I lived with him. For three years. The best time
of my life. That’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: D’you mind my asking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Of course not. Most people like talking
about themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Why didn’t you marry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> (<i>painfully</i>): We meant to get married ...
when we could afford children. And then I ended it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: At least it was my fault. My man was
away; and a boy fell in love with me; it was in the middle
of the war when it seemed it would go on for ever. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
met at a friend’s house; he was in khaki; at a house party.
And then he came to have tea with me at my flat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Were you in love with <i>him</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I couldn’t have married him. But he
was very strong, and good-looking ... and going back
to the front. They knew what they were going back to,
and they laughed. He was the first man younger than I
was who told me that he loved me; and on his last night
in England, as if he was my child, I wanted to give him
everything he asked for. And he asked for me and—I
was glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I’m glad you were. Did he stop at your flat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: We went to an hotel. We had dinner in
the West End. Across the little table—with a shaded
light on it—I kept catching him looking at me....
One evening when nothing mattered but our happiness.
Then he went back to France, and I went home and
told my man—and my life smashed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Didn’t he understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Oh yes, he understood. We went to the
Queen’s Hall the night I told him, and when we got
home talked till five in the morning; it didn’t smash all
at once—it just made a difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Nor do I—altogether. <i>He</i> had an affair
soon afterwards. You see, he’d given up everything of
that sort for me, and I didn’t ... so he didn’t ... it
broke up our life together. Freedom’s a devastating
thing ... a few hours I shall never forget, and a year
of hell afterwards, and I’ve never really made up my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
mind whether I’m glad or sorry.... (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Frankie</span>)
Do you disapprove of me very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Disapprove? No. But I don’t think it’s
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span> (<i>a quick challenge</i>): What’s right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: When I marry I shall have kept myself for
him, whoever he is. And I hope he will, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Oh, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span> (<i>alert</i>): Why did you say “Oh, my dear” like
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Another young man fell in love with me.
(<i>She turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Frankie</span> <i>with a smile</i>.) I’m sorry! I know it
sounds <i>dreadful</i> saying them one after the other, quickly,
like this! But there was a year of being lonely—desperately
lonely. And it hurt the young man, too; so I let him take
me away.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>A pause.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: ... Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Frankie</span>): He was one of your ideal
young men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: And not only innocent; ignorant. He
knew his own needs, vaguely; not mine, at all. I suffered
from his ignorance.... But he taught me something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Why so many married women go on
regarding love-making as horrid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: They’re married to men who don’t know
how to make love. You see, without gentleness and
sensitiveness and consideration—and much that comes
from knowledge, what ought to be complete harmony
can be very disharmonious, what ought to be utterly
satisfying to body and soul can be utterly nerve-racking
and unsatisfactory.... Somebody said that a man who
can’t make love is like an Orang-Utang playing the
fiddle.... It wants learning—the fiddle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: It seems so horrid to make that part of it
so important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I daresay it’s not so important if it’s
right. It’s all-important if it’s wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: If you can’t make love beautiful for your
man, sooner or later, he’ll go to someone who can; or
he’ll want to, which is as bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Are you happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I suppose not, really.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: A man of my own, and children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Doesn’t that prove your way’s wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I’m not saying it’s right or wrong. Gwen
asked me. I’ve told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Thank you.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Colin</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>come in</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Come in and sit down.</p>

answer!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: What sort of questions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Don’t ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I wish somebody’d tell me what love is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>sotto voce, getting out of his wet coat, disappearing
into his bedroom with it</i>): A damned nuisance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: <i>I’ll</i> tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span> (<i>eagerly</i>): I should like to know what <i>you</i> think.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>Thus challenged</i>, <span class="smcap">Colin</span> <i>collects himself; he joins

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: As one gets older, and loses one’s illusions——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: They’re off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: And realises half one’s life has gone, and
there’s an end to it some day, one is apt to get lonely. A
lost atom in an infinity of blackness. In that blackness is
despair. Only one thing can dispel it—Love. Real love.
None of your free sort, John!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What d’you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I mean that love between two people that
doesn’t need anything else, that won’t tolerate anything
else, that’s lasting and tyrannical and jealous, is the
only kind that’s worth while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>reappearing</i>): What he really means is, he’s
getting middle-aged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Real love isn’t free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Now listen, Grandpa; you’re nearly forty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Shut up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You’ve been at it twenty years. Have you ever
had an experience which might be called free?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Don’t be silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You’ve passed the years of adventure, and you
want to settle down. So you say: “Ah, I’m wise and
sane and right, and all you poor young people are wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> (<i>very much at</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>): Do you think you
know all about it because you’re wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: We couldn’t very well make a worse mess than
they have, could we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: I’m not so sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Oh, Frankie! If we sat down with a pencil
and paper and tried to work out a really unclean, intolerant,
silly system, we couldn’t work out a worse one
than exists to-day. Do you realise that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: No, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I could make you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Try—go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Well—to start with ... the obvious things.
(<i>He talks without difficulty, speaking what he has thought
about.</i>) Hundreds of thousands of girls on the streets; and
an incredible amount of sex disease. One in every five
infected! A million or so girls more than men doomed
to a life without love. Some millions of separated people
living without love and not allowed to marry again.
Thousands of marriages where only distaste, and hate,
remain. Ugliness, and cruelty, and intolerance about the
whole subject that makes the sum of unnecessary suffering
almost incredible. Does all that sound like a success?
After all, we’re responsible to the next generation for the
sort of world they’ll find. Have we any right to say, “Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
that’s all right; we can’t do better than that. We needn’t
bother”? Look at all the girls in the world, Frankie—one
lot selling themselves to any man who can pay them; the
rest brought up in a sort of prison of asceticism, as candidates
for the privilege of becoming a man’s married
housekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Oh, come, John! Nowadays there are a great
many “betwixt and betweeners,” as it were!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: The whole thing’s breaking up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Then why bother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: The break-up is all so undirected and casual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Are you so sure it is breaking up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes. Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>definitely, and as the result of previous thought</i>):
The Church is losing its influence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I shouldn’t have thought that mattered
tuppence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It’s fundamental.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: For hundreds of years the Church has had the
most enormous influence by its hold over the lives of men
and women in this way. Hasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Obviously its attitude towards the whole
thing is fundamental.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It regards sex as sin. It’s holy when the Church
permits it in matrimony; and then it’s got to remain holy,
for ever and ever Amen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: As if it did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: They couldn’t stop people loving outside their
rules; but they’ve made them ashamed of it. They’ve
made sex a secret furtive thing. Well, anyhow, we’ve
got <i>our</i> chance now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Why <i>now</i>, particularly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: The Church built the system, and as a binding
force it’s no longer effective. Here’s your society—in a
certain mould; but the power that did the moulding,
that held it together, has gone. It’s vaguely keeping its
shape, at present—but it’s crumbling. It must crumble;
and it’ll have to be remodelled. That was going on,
anyhow. Then the war came. Everything shaken to its
foundations. Personal beliefs, institutions—everything.
The world’s fluid. That’s why it’s all so damnably
important now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: If it’s all as bad as you say, surely if people
lived as Religion tells them, all these terrible things
wouldn’t happen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That’s exactly what the Church says. “Society
must be purified. Men and women must be taught not to
sin.” But what they mean by purifying society is simply
forcing it back under the old rules; what they mean by
Sin is any infringement of those rules. What we say is:
it’s the very narrowness of their rules that has made the
mess, it’s the reverse side of their mistakenness ...
“they make of their bodies a rampart for the protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
of respectable families”—that’s what Balzac says of
prostitutes. “Sacrifices on the altar of monogamy”—Schopenhauer.
Prostitution means disease. You <i>can’t</i> do
away with these things by the old rules. The old rules
are the <i>cause</i> of them. Practice proves it: the countries
with easier divorce laws don’t have more promiscuity;
less. You <i>must</i> tackle the business with new ideas—anyhow,
it’s happening——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What’s happening?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Compare the world of to-day and the Christian
ideal of morality; a man must love one woman and one
woman only; a woman must love one man and one man
only; <i>there must be no sex experience of any kind before or
after marriage</i>. That’s the ideal. And it’s tremendously
important to realise it is the ideal; because either you
agree with it and you’ve got to strive ruthlessly towards
it, or you don’t agree with it, and you’ve got to find
another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Are you so certain decent people don’t live
according to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: I’m not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Take any average collection of people—take
any ordinary audience at a theatre! How many men do
you suppose have loved only their wives?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: One or two, with luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: How many women do you suppose have loved
only their husbands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: All of them. There may be just one or two
who haven’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: You’re an optimist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Anyhow, there are more of them every day;
it’s a matter of mathematics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Decent men don’t pick up girls off the streets.
They love decent women. But if decent men love decent
women—where are the decent women? All over the
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: If you had the rearranging of the world
to-morrow what would you <i>do</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: I’m going home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Not for a minute. Go on, John. What would
you <i>do</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: A minute to recreate the world, John. Hurry
up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It comes down to a question of personal
responsibility. When outside rules go, inside rules have
got to take their places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I mean, life was probably fairly simple to the
early Victorian girl. She was brought up entirely without
any sex in her life, waiting for a man to marry her.
Anything else was so unthinkable that she didn’t think
about it. The rules of her conduct were imposed from
without. She had no decisions to make. So she didn’t
worry. It’s different now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: She’s got no respect for the outside rules; she’s
got to find her inside ones. She <i>is</i> worrying. Whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
you like it or not, she is. A great deal. Talking, thinking,
deciding. Not always as her elders would like. But there
are some fine people among ’em; they’ll do the devil of
a lot to make a better world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I hope that’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: They’re claiming a good deal more out
of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Why shouldn’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Hear, hear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’re a dangerous influence, young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: To you old men; I hope so; you’ve been
damned dangerous to us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: If Religion’s going to have nothing to do
with your new world, what is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You’re mixing up religion and the Church.
There’s got to be a religious spirit; that’s essential;
I mean the spirit that makes you strive to do the
best with your life. I believe some young people to-day
want to live according to their beliefs with a sincerity
that’s religious—anyhow it’s causing nearly as much
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: A lot of conscientious consenters, that’s what
you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Now let’s be <i>personal</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Must we!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: <i>You</i> needn’t talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Needn’t! But I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I know I’m sick of living at home; I know
I’m sick of living alone. The obvious way out is to get
married. But I don’t see how I can ever be certain of
wanting to live all alone with the same person for the
rest of my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: When you’re in love, you’ll know all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That’s easy to say when you’re forty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’re being very unpleasant to me to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I agree with Gwen. Nobody can know until
they’ve tried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What d’you mean, “tried”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Oh, my God, where’s a drink?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>He gets up to help himself to one.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Frankie, it’s been on the tip of my tongue
during these last months to ask you where you wanted
to go most in all the world: and then to ask you to come
with me there, straight away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What fun! Would you have gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I don’t see why. A sort of trial affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: No, Gwen. Much more respectable than that.
Not a trial “affair.” A trial marriage. We should have
gone definitely to find out whether we were suited for
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: That would have been all very nice for
<i>you</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You flatter yourself. It might have been nice
for you, too!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Supposing you’d taken me away and left
me—where should I be then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span> (<i>with his drink</i>): That depends where you
went to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Answer, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: If we parted it would mean it wasn’t successful.
It would be a very good thing for both of us that we
weren’t tied up for life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Anyhow, you’d see a good deal of the world,
John!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: You’d always be going away with different
people all over the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: This is becoming too personal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: You began it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Somebody asked me to rearrange the world;
and I’m doing it. I certainly wouldn’t sweep away all
existing marriage laws all at once——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: When are we coming to what you <i>would</i>
do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I should go all out for a much larger tolerance;
I should allow certain special relationships, <i>within</i> the
present system, to be open and decent and honourable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: There <i>is</i> something else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: ... It’s difficult to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Good heavens! Somebody’s found something
they can’t say. It must be awful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Go on, Frankie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Well—if you go away with somebody—and
it’s a failure, and you part, for the girl it’s not just
as you were, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: No. I see what you mean ... it seems to me,
chastity is a thing nobody has any right to inflict upon
anybody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Hear hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It may be fine when it’s undertaken from real
personal belief, but it’s not worth tuppence when it’s
meant a tremendous effort of starvation that achieves
nothing but starvation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: You know a lot of girls are quite tranquil
and untouched by all this, until it’s thrust under their
noses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: That’s it. That’s where you’re so wrong,
John. You don’t save girls from trouble, you <i>make</i> it
for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Quite a lot <i>aren’t</i> tranquil. It’s wicked to keep
people from love, when you needn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Surely you have to deal with every case on its
merits. When I have a daughter——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: When you have a daughter, you won’t be
talking like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I shall want my daughter to be happily married;
<i>and this is the real answer to you, Frankie</i>. If you want a
happy, lasting marriage, the love-making part of it has
got to be successful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: It’s fundamental. Bed-rock. The rock on
which most marriages split, and up to now it’s been just
left to chance ... a girl must have absolutely no real
emotional experience until she’s married. Her first real
experience may alter her whole being, yet by the time
she’s allowed that first experience she must have tied
herself up for life. Now I don’t think that’s merely silly.
<i>I think it’s definitely wrong.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I agree with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Grandpa agrees with me. I must be right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes, my child, but I think you’ve got to be
extremely careful over this experimenting business of
yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’ve got the artistic temperament, God
help you. Most people haven’t. The majority of ordinary
respectable human beings just want quiet, uneventful,
peaceful lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You can just as easily wreck people’s happiness
by persuading them to go experimenting all over the
place, as by denying them the right to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Don’t just say “Don’t, don’t, don’t.” That’s
negative ... a denial of things. We can’t live by that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: My dear—Miss Freeman, I’m not denying
the years of adventure, as John calls them. Anyhow,
they’ll remain for a good many, whatever we say. But
when it comes to arranging a new system, keep adventure
for adventure’s sake for the unfortunate artistic people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
They’ll hurt themselves. And make a song about it.
But if ordinary people get into the habit of fluttering
from experience to experience they damned easily lose
the stability or the capacity for happiness. And undisturbed
love between two people is the highest happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: But supposing you don’t find it, or make a
mistake the first time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: I’m not denying the right of the ordinary
person to experiment, but it ought to be for the definite
object of discovering a true lover, and making a lasting
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And if you help people to find their real mates,
and when they’ve made a mistake, help them out of it
quietly and decently, you’ll have many more happy
marriages and much less beastliness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Yes, I agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> (<i>rising</i>): Well, I’m glad we’ve settled
<i>that</i>!! Now I’m going home. Good night, Gwen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Frankie</span>): Good night ... don’t think
me an abandoned woman——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span>: I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>: Good night, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ll come down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: Got a cigarette, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span>: Having tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Freeman</span> (<i>at the speaking-tube</i>): Hullo!...
John! <i>Is that you?</i> Are you up there!... What d’you

here before he’s finished his tea; ... a week ago;
never a word to anyone; a week—I didn’t tell you all
about that evening; that girl up in his room; when I
went in there she was ... well, never mind—and then
this morning, he walks into my office, as calm as you like,
and informs me, if you please, he does not intend to marry
Frankie.... And that’s not all. Oh no. Not by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>

it ... throw the whole thing up.</p>

enough when you’re married, and ’ave a ’usband to look
after yer; and yer mother’s pleased.... I can’t never
tell my mother. I can’t tell nobody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: You’ve told us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosie</span>: Oh, it’s all right for <i>you</i>, miss—<i>you</i> don’t
know. You can’t do nothing. I went to a chemist w’ot ’e
told me of—a long way off it was, on a tram—and they
as good as kicked me out. Then I goes to a doctor; I ’as
to go alone. I rings the bell, and the man w’ot opened the

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It’s a bit of a red light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Well ... you’ve got to remember when
you talk about all this, it <i>does</i> happen to people. It happened
to the eldest Gillingham girl.... I didn’t know
much about it; but she had the most terrible time....
You can imagine ... what Rosie said—<i>helpless</i> ...
awful. (<i>She thinks for a while; then her eyes, wandering,
light on the tea-things.</i>) Do you want some tea?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes ... thanks.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Gwen</span> <i>pours out his tea and gives it to him; and
pours out her own and, sitting, stirs it, reflectively.
These two are very fond of one another, and at ease
together; there is a quality of gentleness in their bearing
to each other.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: ... It doesn’t frighten me ... really ...
not if you stop to think ... you needn’t have a baby,
need you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Nearly everybody, in our class, limits their
families.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: If you make up your mind it’s not wrong to
love without having children, it’s awfully <i>weak</i> to
change your mind just because someone else has one by
mistake, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: But, Jacko ... you know ... all the
same ... the people who are against you would pick
on Rosie; they’d say, there’s a girl with her life ruined,
and her baby’s life ruined; and if you had your way,
there’d be more and more like her....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Fools!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes, but what’s the answer, Jacko?</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>She speaks, and listens, always, with a simple
direct eagerness for understanding, and points of view.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: The answer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ... Well ... in the first place: there are
plenty of Roses, now, aren’t there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Thousands. The streets are strewn with their
petals; and the winds that strew them, blow out of
unhappy homes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Out of unsuccessful marriages; and lonely
separations. They can’t boast such a success with their
Roses, as things <i>are</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And in the second place, if Rosie’d been <i>your</i>
daughter, or mine, she’d have had a different education
about it all.... Wouldn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: What Rosie knows, she knows from cinemas,
and giggling talks with other girls and occasional young
men. Whatever “teaching” she’s had, has been just
<i>Don’t</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes. Just “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t; it’s wicked,”
all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Exactly; about its real possibilities, and its real
dangers, she knew nothing; and along comes this man;
and over she goes!... If she’d belonged to us, she’d
have known what she was doing; either she wouldn’t
have had an affair with this man at all—he’s apparently
left her in the lurch—or, if it was a thing of real value
in their lives, she wouldn’t have had a child; unless she
wanted it; and was prepared to face up to the whole
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And in the third place, now that it <i>has</i> happened,
half her trouble is her <i>fear</i>; the disgrace of it. If instead
of cursing her, and blaming her, and pushing her away,
people would help her, it wouldn’t be so very terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: There’s her baby....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Gwen; an epileptic woman in a slum can have
twelve children by a confirmed drunkard. Which is
worse? That; or this baby of Rosie’s? But as long as it’s
in “holy matrimony,” people can have dozens of children
with no earthly chance of looking after them—and your
moralists make no objection; but they’ll torture young
Rosie till she thinks of suicide.... The whole question
of children—I’m sure it’s a matter of <i>clear thinking</i>.
It’s so damned important we should think clearly....
Love between two people is a personal relationship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I can’t see that anybody has a right to interfere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: But as soon as you have a child, it’s more than
personal; it’s a social relationship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And the Law oughtn’t to be concerned with
the personal side of it at all; but with the social—with
the obligations to the children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.... What would you do about children
in your trial marriages?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There oughtn’t to be any; not until they’ve
set out to be permanent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>[<i>Up to this point the talk has been quiet; they have
been helping themselves, and each other, to their teas.</i></p>

<p>[<i>Now</i>, <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>is impelled from within to move. His
own convictions, with the sense of a world in opposition,
trouble him; his sentences jerk out: all underlined, as it
were.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: But it’s just because as many permanent
happy marriages as possible seems the best way it’s so
damned important for people to make a good choice ...
with full knowledge ... and so, with a real hope of
being lasting and happy; and to help them <i>out</i> when they’ve
made a mistake ... it wouldn’t be so difficult if people
would be open-minded and sane about it ... people just
point out difficulties and dangers, and think they’ve
smashed our case ... of course there’d be difficulties and
unhappiness; love’s not simple ... but look at it all <i>now</i>.
That’s what they forget. Look at it <i>now</i>....</p>

<p>When one thinks of the Prejudices, and Intolerance;
of all the <i>Righteousness</i> that stands between us and a
happier world, it drives one mad.... Have you walked
through a slum lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I did; yesterday; ... thousands of babies
rolling about in filth; and you only see them outside,
where at least there’s a square inch of open sky above
them.</p>

<p>Think of them inside. Whole families in one room.
The mothers and fathers, growing brothers and sisters,
and new-born babies; all together; day and night; in
every city in the civilised world.... Think of it, for a
moment ... <i>intimately</i>.... Good God! Talk about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
leading little children astray. A civilisation that tolerates
it ought to have a millstone round its neck; ... as a
matter of fact, it has; the thing itself is a millstone;
dragging us down; fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: How! Why: if anybody has the quality to rise
out of it, he gets on at his job, marries above him and
doesn’t have children. The worst are pouring out children,
the best are more or less barren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: But, John, if the worst are increasing so much
the fastest, things may get worse and worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Then why doesn’t somebody <i>do</i> something!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: For various reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Religion doesn’t do anything because it thinks
Birth Control wicked. Big Business doesn’t do anything,
because it wants cheap Labour; the Governments don’t
do anything because they want soldiers for the next
war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: The next war!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: The next war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Jacko, do you think there is going to be a next
war?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Who’s going to stop it? We’re all arming again
as fast as we can go. Submarines and aeroplanes; blockade
and starvation; bombs and poison gas from the air that’ll
exterminate whole cities at a go! (<i>He is speaking with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
great emphasis.</i>) D’you realise one of the leading scientists
of the world has said that the millions of London could
be blotted out in three hours! You may say that’s an
exaggeration; it may be; but at the rate science is going
it won’t be in a few years. “Easy and inexpensive”—that’s
what a Cabinet Minister said about poison gas;
and they’re all making it; as fast as they can go; and
fleets of aeroplanes to drop it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Do you mean that the children I may have,
or you may have, may be just wiped out in another war,
more terrible than the last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Why not? When nations are armed to the teeth,
the arms go off, sooner or later. It always has been so;
there’s no reason why it should be any different now;
unless there was a change of spirit; and there’s no sign
of that. Why should there be? The old ideas are still in
power; all over the world; the very same men mostly;
you see, <i>they</i> survive wars!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: But can’t <i>we</i> do something? Why should we
have children for that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: My dear, they laugh at <i>us</i>. And at anybody else
who suggests they aren’t wisdom incarnate ... unless
we ever became effective against them; then they’d find
a way of downing us. You’ve only got to read the newspapers:
speeches by generals, and admirals—and bishops;
threatenings by politicians; in every country; the old
financial interests at work under it all; and the great mass
of the people, in every country, struggling all day just to
exist, absolutely incapable of independent thought, and
ready to believe what any newspaper tells them three days
running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: John! ... if it’s like that, what’s the good
of anything! It doesn’t seem worth going on, or
trying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Oh yes, it’s worth it. If the smash comes the
few ideals that are left will float upward, and have some
influence on what comes next. Something’s got to come
next!... Men <i>could</i> free themselves from war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Could they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: And from all the other forces that make them
suffer so. They’re not natural forces; they’re forces men
have made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Then why don’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ... And it isn’t for want of courage or
nobility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Then why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There’s no <i>will</i> to do it, and that’s because
there’s no understanding.... I often think, now, of
being in the trenches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There was a joy in it; at first, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: <i>You</i> say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Comradeship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: The friends you made....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: No. The strangers on the road, day and night,
at the same task; one’s rest and play only to give one
strength for it; a <i>purpose</i> that gave meaning to every
moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Oh, Jacko, something in me leaps to that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: For five years the men under forty worked
together, sacrificed everything they had in life, every
hope, prospect, comfort; they underwent suffering,
physical suffering and moral suffering, absolutely inconceivable
to those who stayed at home, so that to give
their lives at the end of it was often a relief ... and
they won! By God, Gwen, if the men over forty with
the money and the power would get together and work
<i>one-twentieth</i> as well, and sacrifice <i>one-hundredth</i> of their
personal comfort, what mightn’t they make of the victory—but
they won’t! They won’t, because they see no
reason why they should. They’ve got no <i>faith</i> to make
them. They’ve got nothing great to <i>believe in</i>....
To-day, the wisest of men are cynical, and the cleverest
are rich, and none are happy.... There’s no great
purpose outside our own lives to give them harmony and
meaning. Ask the ordinary people, in the streets, and
tubes, and ’buses ... what they’re living <i>for</i>; they
don’t know.... All the old <i>duties</i>—our duty to our
parents; to our country; to God; they’ve been prostituted;
they demanded our blood; and took it; and gave
us nothing in return but a dreadful sense of futility ...
we’ve got to find something truer to believe in....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Can we find something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ... Why not, just ... our duty to our
fellows.... Suppose we all started in with that as a
<i>Religion</i>; with half the will we went to war; a common
purpose so deeply felt that everybody was ready to spend
their lives for it, and make any sacrifices that were called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
for; I’d be a parson if that was religion, teaching that
common purpose—just to clear up the mess a bit; so
that the generation that’s waiting just outside the doors
of existence, should come in and find it a happier place;
it ’ud be a dam’ sight happier place for those in it <i>now</i>,
anyhow! and we’d soon do away with any fear of another
war; that ’ud be something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: John, do you think there’s a hope?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There’s always hope—in the young people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Do you believe that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: What other hope is there? There are millions
and millions waiting to be born; they haven’t got all the
prejudices and hatreds that cause the trouble; they get
’em from us; we’ve got to give ’em something better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: And shall we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: If we don’t, they’ll go through all the hell that
we’ve been through, probably a worse hell than anything
we’ve known yet—in this country, anyhow—and then
their children, and their children’s children, will try
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: But <i>now</i>! Can’t we do anything now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: We ought to try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That’s what I feel. That’s why I’m chucking
the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Follow my urge! That’s all I can do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What’s that mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I’ve got a few hundred pounds in the bank;
and I’m selling my piano, and everything else I can. I’m
going to write; and think and read; and get into touch
with any others I can, who feel as we do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes. What are you going to write?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: I want to try and write something for the
ordinary sort of person, who’s just lost and discontented.
There <i>are</i> some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Heaps and heaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That might be my job; it’s not much; when
one talks of <i>doing</i>, what can one <i>do</i>, oneself, seems so
inadequate. But it would have been a poor excuse before
a tribunal: “I’m not going to join up.” “Why?” “I
don’t see myself winning the war single-handed” ...
plenty only stopped a bullet going into something else.
I may only encourage somebody else to do something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: You’re lucky having something you know
you ought to do. I wish I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: There’s one way all our lot can help: it’s
probably the best way, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: To live by what you believe, which is difficult
... and not by what you don’t believe, which is
easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: If you can, you’re a fanatic! But I believe
you’ve got to have something of a fanatic in you to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
anything worth while these days. The thing is to keep
one’s fanaticism, and to keep one’s humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Jacko! It <i>is</i> important to live what you
believe, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: <i>I</i> think so; tremendously; I think, if this
generation misses its opportunity, <i>which it may</i>, it’s
because we’ve lost the old beliefs and haven’t taken the
trouble to get a new one for ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes. Oh, there are such heaps of people “lost
and discontented”; I know such heaps of girls like that.
They just don’t know where they are; they make an
awful mess of things sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You do, if you don’t know where you are. You
know, if we’re not careful, there’ll be a period of aimless
licence, and then reaction. It’s a critical time all right.
A puritan reaction; and all the old inhibitions and
denials and secrecies <i>clamped down</i> on our children
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It makes everything seem unimportant except
doing one’s bit; doesn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: It’s funny that just when I’m beginning to
feel like that, there <i>is</i> something in my life that’s important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: You won’t laugh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I only wish it didn’t seem so important ...
you won’t laugh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: You’ll get a clump on the head in a minute,
if you keep on asking me not to laugh ... what
is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I’m in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Colin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Oh damn! Is it so obvious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: ’Tisn’t obvious a bit; up to a second ago I
hadn’t a notion; but you’ve seen a good deal of him these
last two weeks, haven’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: He’s taken me out nearly every day; theatres
and dinners; I’ve never had such a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Does he love you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I don’t think so; I don’t think he cares a bit
more for me than for all the others he takes about. I’m
a fool! I dread every time I see him in case I should find
out it’s no good; but every time he goes away, life’s just
waiting for the next time I see him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: <i>Sure?</i> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: That you love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: Enough to marry him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>: By jove, Gwen, I’d like you to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span> (<i>brokenly</i>): Oh, Jacko....</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

round and get someone in their lives, and then look
round and wonder whether someone else wouldn’t give
them a fuller life! I’ve no use for it. I know a good deal

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You know that. I don’t want to pretend. Not

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span> (<i>with a little cry</i>): Oh, why did you say that?
You know I want them, too; but not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: My dear love; if you want to see life, or the
world, a bit first—of course—there’s nowhere you can’t
go; nothing you can’t have for the asking; I’m going to
give the rest of my life to give you everything you want.</p>

true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I believe with all my soul to marry you now,

<i>right</i>! If I did, it would only be to save bother. I want
to do what’s right. Oh, I can’t talk; I can’t say what
I mean; I feel it; it isn’t only myself ... it’s the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: The others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes; we’re supposed to; it isn’t easy to hold
out; some girls are; I want to be on their side; I want
to keep hold of my part in the future; if I give in right
at the beginning, how can I ever take any part, or interest
ever again, without being ashamed ... if that’s a
“stunt”; if it’s all “rot” to you ... it’s no good;
you’d better go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: Yes; I love you; make no mistake about that.
I don’t know what I shall do, if you go.... I love
you so much, I don’t want our first love to be spoiled by
feeling I’m doing wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colin</span>: You’re obstinate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwen</span>: I can’t help it.... Oh, Colin, please, don’t
you see ... if <i>you’re</i> certain, it’ll make no difference

and I don’t want it to be spoiled, and I think
we <i>ought</i> to get married.</p>

Of course. But six times a week! The thing becomes
